    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// let source: DatabaseQueue = ...
    /// let destination: DatabaseQueue = ...
    /// try source.write { sourceDb in
    ///     try destination.barrierWriteWithoutTransaction { destDb in
    ///         try sourceDb.backup(to: destDb)
    ///     }

    /// ```
    ///
    /// When you're after progress reporting during backup, you'll want to
    /// perform the backup in several steps. Each step copies the number of
    /// _database pages_ you specify. See <https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/backup_finish.html>
    /// for more information:
    ///
    /// ```swift
    /// // Backup with progress reporting
    /// try sourceDb.backup(to: destDb, pagesPerStep: ...) { progress in
    ///     print("Database backup progress:", progress)
    /// }
    /// ```

    /// The `progress` callback will be called at least onceâ€”when
    /// `backupProgress.isCompleted == true`. If the callback throws
    /// when `backupProgress.isCompleted == false`, the backup is aborted
    /// and the error is rethrown. If the callback throws when
    /// `backupProgress.isCompleted == true`, backup completion is
    /// unaffected and the error is silently ignored.
    ///
    /// See also ``DatabaseReader/backup(to:pagesPerStep:progress:)``.
    ///
    /// - parameters:
    ///     - destDb: The destination database.
    ///     - pagesPerStep: The number of database pages copied on each backup
    ///       step. By default, all pages are copied in one single step.
    ///     - progress: An optional function that is notified of the backup
    ///       progress.
    /// - throws: A ``DatabaseError`` whenever an SQLite error occurs, or the
    ///   error thrown by `progress`.
